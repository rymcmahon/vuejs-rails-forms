## Using Vue.js as an Alternative to Rails Nested Forms

This is the code I used for a blog post that explored how to use Vue.js instead of Rails nested forms when you want to hit multiple models within the same form.

The blog post can be found [here.](http://www.rymcmahon.com/articles/9)

I deployed the code to Heroku, so you can try it out [here.](https://vuejs-rails-forms.herokuapp.com/)

### Details

* Vue.js v1.0.26
* Rails 5.0.0.1
* Bootstrap-sass 
* PostgreSQL
